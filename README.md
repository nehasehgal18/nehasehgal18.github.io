      <p style="color: pink";>In Pakistan except for a very few Government experiments with important fowls, the birds are supposed to be able to look after themselves. The result is that village fowls are usually thin and undersized, scratching about for any scrap of food or grains of rice that may be thrown away, But there is not much thrown away bye the villagers or the poor anywhere in the times we live in. The fowl of the Pakistan village usually weighs from one and a half to two pounds and its eggs are about twelve to the pound. In England, birds of five pounds weight are common, and eggs averaging six to the pound are quite usual.[the_ad id=”17141″]

Unless fowls are in fertile crop land, or forest, they must be fed. Gram and maize are excellenet foods for chickens, also rice and dal. In Europe, a farmer of chickens usually gives his birds a hot meal each morning, made of corn-meal, scraps of mashed potato and all other waste foods which are left at meals. His birds are fed as regularly as his children, and the result is big. Healthy fowls and large & eggs in plenty. In addition, fowls must have a good supply of some green vegetable leaves; they must have pure water to drink as well as a place big enough for them to have a “bath” if they feel inclined. Their houses, in which they rest at night, must be carefully cleaned when necessary, and the nests in which they lay their eggs must also be supplied with clean hay or grass.

Treated carefully on those lines, fowl-breeding on a large scale can be made a profitable occupation, by supplying the market with fowls and eggs. But many people assume that the birds can look after themselves and scratch a meal out of the dry ground in summer. Their birds will be thin, not worth offering to a critical customer, and the eggs will be small and new. This, like other branches of farming, is most profitable when pursued scientifically and with industry.

      <p>For a Hindu, cow is a sacred animal. Cow is a symbol of life and they believe that they should be protected. Cow is a very generous animal and people consider that a cow gives more to the civilization that what she receives. In past killing a cow was as equal to killing a Brahmin and therefore was considered to be the biggest sin of all times.

The Vedas, which are considered to be the oldest and sacred source of literature has also mentioned cow at many instances. The oldest Veda that is the Rig Veda has mentioned a dialog between Sage Vishvamitra and two rivers, Sutlej and Beas, in which the river was compared to horses and cow. This shows that cow was considered to be a holy animal.

The cow was also associated with Aditi, the mother of all the Gods. Lord Krishna is also associated with cow. In India, we always find the image of cow almost everywhere, whether it is a shop or a temple, with garland and flowers as a sign of faith. At the time of Sanskritization, the people living lower strata gave up beef when they wanted to take a jump to higher strata of the society.

During the freedom struggle, Gandhi attempted to make a taboo against beef eating saying that the idea of non-violence is associated with cow. But contrary to this fact, he never openly asked to ban cow slaughter. Hindus are often vegetarian, a few of them has eat non-vegetarian food as well, but they could not even thing of consuming beef as a part of their diet.Even the interior and exterior design of the sushi bar is the indication of Zen Buddhism.3 In addition, there are several forms of sushi thrived separately in different regions of Japan, representing these regions.5 For instance, Kinki region has Kakino-ha zushi, the sushi packed in the persimmon leaf, and Sanma-zushi, which is the salted Pacific saury sushi, whereas Kyushu and Okinawa region is famous for Buen Zushi, referred to a type of sushi made with snapper.

Sushi chefs are highly respected by Japanese people.7 The reason behind it is that they need to spend at least ten years and undergo a tough and bitter experience to have the qualifications working behind the sushi bar. From cleaning the kitchen, shadowing their chef mentor, and cooling the prepared rice to making rice, mastering the professional knife skills, and making sushi rolls at the side, the apprentices need to be competent to do these tasks before becoming a respectful sushi chef. The official jobs of the sushi chefs are apparently more than these duties. Besides that, Japanese have set the rule.<a href="#top">Back to Top</a></p>

      <p style="color: lightblue";>Sushi is a Japanese cuisine consisting of vinegared rice and different seafood as the main ingredient while vegetables or other ingredients are sometimes used as well. Sushi has undergone intense and spectacular modern transformation. Nonetheless, the only unchanged ingredient that all types of sushi have is rice as the name of sushi literally means “vinegar rice”.1 In this paper, the history of sushi, its cultural importance in Japan, and its value to Japanese people so context in Japan are unfolded based on the information gathered from eight credible articles.

Sushi is considered to be an ancient Japanese art from the time when it was a popular dish in the party of the crown prince of Pacific Rim.4 Based on It includes all five senses of the body; the sense of satisfaction can derive from simply looking at the food.1 Sushi typifies a national art of Japan by interpreting the white of the rice and the red color of the fish as the white and red found on the Japanese flag.1  Furthermore, from preparing sushi to eating sushi, the Zen Buddhism concept is divulged.3 The astonishing art of sushi can only be described using Japanese poetry or philosophy, haiku and wabi sabi respectively, which both consist of the ideas of Zen. Even the interior and exterior design of the sushi bar is the indication of Zen Buddhism.3 In addition, there are several forms of sushi thrived separately in different regions of Japan, representing these regions.5 For instance, Kinki region has Kakino-ha zushi, the sushi packed in the persimmon leaf, and Sanma-zushi, which is the salted Pacific saury sushi, whereas Kyushu and Okinawa region is famous for Buen Zushi, referred to a type of sushi made with snapper.
